You are a bitcoin miner.
Your goal is to mine as much as possible.
To achieve this, you need to upgrade your PC, to increase throughput.
You can increase the speed at which you mine and the amount you mine with each update.
Measure: n B(it)C(oins) / second
Updates occur in realtime, so it can happen that 0.5 seconds elapsed or 50 seconds.
Updates should be processed one-by-one.



Speed increasing components:
	CPU
		base price: 100$
		price per upgrade: 100$ + (25$ * pow(10%, nextlevel))
		base speed: 60s
		speed per upgrade: -2s
	GPU
		base price: 500$
		price per upgrade: 500$ + (100$ * pow(25%, nextlevel))
		base speed: 30s
		speed per upgrade: -1s
		
Amount increasing components:
	RAM
		base price: 5$
		price per upgrade: 5$ + (2$ * pow(12%, nextLevel))
		base amount: 8 kB
		amount per upgrade: 8 kB
	
Upgrades
	BOT -> DOUBLE EVERYTHING (as if there was another PC, exponentially)
